  - BIG GOAL: Press a button in test scene that progresses flower
              from a seedling to a mature flower in stages.
              The shape of these stages are determined using a 
              hex string (the flower generator's "seed").
    Parts of this involve:

    - Stem generation tweaks
    x - Have angle changes follow a curve function
      - Have distance changes follow a pattern (usually decreasing...)
      - Increase variability of the node below the root node
      - Have the 'height' of the nodes decrease as it grows
      - Record the stems' nodes in the stem component
      - Vary the root node's location
      - Add mirrored stem parameter
      - Vary the number of stems

    - Having flower mini-stems shoot off at parts along the stem
      - Have a mini stem shoot off at a node
      - Generate a list of 'possible ministem positions'
      - Generate a mini stem at a position if it passes a probability
        curve and a random test
    - Organize 2BezierSpline functions in Spline2D into a new class
    - Organize OrchidController functions into their own classes
    - Having flower buds age and grow according to their 'age'
    






    ON HOLD:
    - (get flower stuff done first) Having new leaves be created, sized, 
      and oriented
      - Try changing scale of x and y of the leaves randomly
      - Change the scale of previous leaves as they get "flattened"
      - Have the new leaf poke up in between stages


  - BIG GOAL: Create flower gentle breeze movement.
    - Have leaves sway up and down a little
    - Have stem move left and right a little, with the end of the 
        stem having a slight whiplash
    - Have flowers lag behind a tiny bit, but follow movement

  - BIG GOAL: Create more variation in orchids.
    Parts of this involve:
    - Flower color
    - Flower pattern
    - Flower shape
    - Flower number
    - Flower placement
    - Stem number
    - Stem branching
    - Stem direction
    - Leaf # and orientation 
    - Flower lifespan

  - BIG GOAL: Create an actual game scene, with the most basic
              functionality (place flowers, move flowers).
    - Create home screen placeholder art assets
      - Shelves
      - Background
      - Non-functional placeholder UI
      - Sprite that indicates a spot where a plant can be placed
    - Create a game scene, arrange art assets in it
    - Create ability to place a flower after pressing a 'shop' button
    - Create ability to move a flower to another spot

  - BIG GOAL: Create a shop scene, where you can get more flowers.
    - Create UI showing how much money you have.
    - Have the 'shop' button move you to a new 'shop' scene
    - No fanciness yet, you just see a selection of plants and their
      prices.
    - Clicking on a plant asks you whether you want to buy it.
    - Clicking 'yes' adds the plant to your inventory.
    - You can place the plant in your greenhouse by clicking the 'home'
      button and placing it.

  - BIG GOAL: Polish home screen
    - Add sunrays that move
    - Add occasional insects outside
    - Add birds that fly outside
    - Create night scene
    - Create rainy scene
    - Create snowy scene
